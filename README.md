# Tic Tac Toe Game
## Made with React
### A big part of code has been taken from official 'intro to React' tutorial, but I included:
* My own RWD design that takes advantage of 2017 CSS Grid 
* Function that highlights the winner's fields
* PropTypes
* Very simple and basic tests with Enzyme and Chai
### To play the game:
	git clone https://github.com/AlanPieczonka/ReactTicTacToe.git
	cd ReactTicTacToe
	npm install
	npm start 
### To run tests: 
	npm test test.js

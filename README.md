# Tic Tac Toe Game
## Made with React
### A big part of code is taken from official 'intro to React' tutorial, but I included my own RWD design, function that highlights the winner's fields, PropTypes and basic tests. 

	git clone https://github.com/AlanPieczonka/ReactTicTacToe.git
	cd ReactTicTacToe
	npm install
	npm start 

### To run tests: 
	npm test test.js
